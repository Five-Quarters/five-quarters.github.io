I'm John Davey, an artist and printmaker based in the North West of England. 

Five Quarters features my creative and quirky prints along with some other products such as cards and t-shirts.

Mostly I create lino prints - I discovered a love for the medium in 2014, and soon after that I bought an old victorian book press for printing them.

I originally trained as an illustrator and spent many years working in illustration and design.

Currently, there's a giant version of one of my lino prints outside the Markets in Preston city centre.  

'3 Fishes' was selected as one of nine artworks to display as part of the 'Fill the Frame' project. The artwork, which is as tall as I am, was blown up from a print that was only 7.5 x 11cm!
