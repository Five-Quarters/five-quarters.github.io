I'm John Davey, an artist and printmaker based in the North West of England. 

Five Quarters features my prints (lino prints and monoprints), along with some greetings cards and t-shirts.

I discovered a love for lino printing in 2014, and soon after that I bought an old victorian book press for printing them.

I originally trained as an illustrator and spent many years working in illustration and design.

I'm pleased to say that I've recently had three prints accepted for the King Street Arts 8th Annual Art Fair.

The exhibition is at The Storey main gallery in Lancaster from 29th November to 13th December 2024.

<b>Shhhh...prints on show</b><br />
In September 2024 I had two prints displayed in the Lancaster University Library open call exhibition, and was really pleased to be one of only two artists to have two pieces accepted. 

For the catalogue entries, I created a ‘subtitle for librarians’ for each print that detailed the location of a book in the library that relates to the topic of the artwork.

<b>Big fishes</b><br />
Since early 2024, there’s been a giant version of one of my lino prints outside the Markets in Preston city centre.  

‘3 Fishes’ was selected as one of nine artworks to display as part of the ‘Fill the Frame’ project. The artwork, which is as tall as I am, was blown up from a print that was only 7.5 x 11cm!
