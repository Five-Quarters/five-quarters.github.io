I'm John Davey, an artist and printmaker based in the North West of England. Five Quarters features my creative and quirky lino prints.

I originally trained as an illustrator and spent many years working in illustration and design. More recently I've been working in communications.

I've been creating lino prints since discovering a love for the medium in 2014.

You can [see my prints](/prints/) on this site, and can buy them in my [Five Quarters Etsy shop](https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/FiveQuartersUK).
