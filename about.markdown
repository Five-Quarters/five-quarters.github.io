I'm John Davey, an artist and printmaker based in the North West of England. 

Five Quarters features my creative and quirky prints along with some other products such as cards and t-shirts.

Mostly I create lino prints - I discovered a love for the medium in 2014, and soon after that I bought an old victorian book press for printing them.

I originally trained as an illustrator and spent many years working in illustration and design.

You can [see my prints](/prints/) on this site, and can buy them in my [Five Quarters Etsy shop](https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/FiveQuartersUK).
